# press-start-to-begin

Spending too much time deciding what to learn next?

This app makes self-studying CS easier by compiling a curated list of lessons (in text, audio, video, or interactive formats) in a fun todo list!

## How do things make it in here?

Everything in here is freely available on the internet. If it's open source, even better!

## Setup

Clone, then run:
* `npm i`
* `npm start`
