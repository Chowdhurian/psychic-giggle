During a twitter chat in the [CodeNewbies community](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies), a few people liked the idea of being inspired by the early projects of experienced programmers.
Maybe if there was a way where more experienced programmers could encourage newer programmers by allowing them to see their early code.
So maybe this project can help more people as a voluntarily-shared collection of the early work of more experienced programmers.
